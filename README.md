- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew.
- 👀 I’m interested in testing and philosophies therein, web service architecture, automation, and art created through technology (not you dall e 2 and similar)
- 🌱 I’m currently the team lead of GSD, which owns RentOps. I try to offer guidance and set good patterns of behavior more than control what code is written or how it is written.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anywhere I can help.
- 📫 How to reach me: slack is preferable inside ES and email if you're outside of ES
